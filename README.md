# Hi, I'm Anton 👋

I'm a C/C++ developer with a focus on systems programming, computer graphics, and algorithms.  
Graduate of Codam (42 Network), where I completed multiple low-level and math-heavy software engineering projects.

I enjoy building things from scratch — ray tracers, HTTP servers, simulation tools — and learning through deep technical problem solving.
